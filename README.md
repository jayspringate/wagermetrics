Problem domain: Gather a data set consisting of all NBA games played in the 2014-2015 season, and make it sortable by a list of parameters, giving the user the ability to analyze the performance of any given data subset against the spread or over/under.

The Wagermetrics Trend Analyzer uses real data from NBA games that has been scraped from the web, and allows the user to filter games from the database based on team, court, status, opponent, and point spread, and gives output informing the user how the chosen data subset has fared against the spread and total. This data helps identify hard-to-find trends and patterns. This specific data in an easily filterable, sortable format does not currently exist on the web.
